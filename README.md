# React + Vite

https://thunderous-kashata-485cb8.netlify.app/

In my project, you can access detailed information about starships from the Star Wars film series and learn about the starship you're looking for through filtering. I used CSS and JavaScript (React) for this project. I utilized Axios to fetch data from another website. I worked on Component, Context API, and state management topics.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
